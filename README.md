# New-CSS-versioning-proposal
#### This repository is intended for a versioning proposal by the W3C group. The means of control are still being analyzed by the group, so this is not yet official.

CSS is something incredible! from his birth to the present moment, we are grateful that he helped us take a huge weight out of HTML (styling objects in the DOM), but recently there is a great discussion in the world of CSS, the discussion would be about the hitherto emergence of CSS4. We are divided between those who think about the possible emergence of CSS4 and others who, like me, think that there will be no new CSS.

The idea here is to take a simpler solution in controlling the version of the CSS (redoing yourself in a friendly style of understanding and facilitating support), for such a model, I did a research in my work and with friends in the area, where many were in favor.

The initial proposal tends to follow the following model: CSS-Level-number-year of increments, that way we can control the versions in a more friendly way, because at the end of everything the CSS plus the level is a version control and not a tool that was born today as many think. The CSS since its beginning of development had its life cycle badly produced, with that we have today a great number of people who think that with each increment made, a new CSS emerged, when in fact it is a single CSS.
